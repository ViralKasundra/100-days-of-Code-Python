**Project: Text Analysis Tool**

**Objective:** 

Create a Python program that reads multiple text files, processes the text, and finds the most common words in the collection of files.

**Requirements:**

The program should take a directory as input and analyze all text files within that directory.

It should read the content of each file, tokenize the text into words, and store them in a list.

Common words like "the," "and," "is," etc., should be excluded from the analysis.

The program should then count the frequency of each word.

Finally, it should display the top N most common words and their frequencies.
