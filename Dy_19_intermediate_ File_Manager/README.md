**Create a Python-based file manager that allows users to list and filter files in a directory using generators and iterators.**

**Functional Requirements:**

**File Listing:**

**Users can input a directory path.**

The system will list all files within the specified directory and its subdirectories using an iterator.

**Filter Files by Extension:**

Users can choose to filter files based on a specific file extension (e.g., 'txt', 'jpg').
The system will generate a list of files matching the selected extension using a generator.

**Filter Files by Size:**

Users can select a minimum file size (in bytes).

The system will generate a list of files that meet or exceed the specified size using a generator.

**Efficient Data Processing:**

Implement iterators and generators to efficiently process and filter files in the specified directory.

Use generators for filtering to minimize memory consumption.

**Usability:**

The application should have a user-friendly command-line interface.

Provide clear instructions for users to input directory paths and filter criteria.

Error Handling:
Implement error handling to gracefully manage issues such as invalid directory paths or file operations.
