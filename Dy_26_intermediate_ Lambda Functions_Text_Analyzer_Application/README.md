**Text Analyzer Application**

**1. Introduction**

**1.1 Purpose**

The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for the development of a Text Analyzer Application.

**1.2 Scope**

The Text Analyzer Application is designed to analyze and process input text, providing users with various statistics and information about the text, including word count, character count, average word length, most common words, unique words, the longest word, and average sentence length.

****2. Functional Requirements****

**2.1 Input**

The application should allow users to input text through a graphical user interface.

**2.2 Word Count**

The application should calculate and display the total word count of the input text.

**2.3 Character Count**

The application should calculate and display the total character count of the input text.

**2.4 Average Word Length**

The application should calculate and display the average length of words in the input text.

**2.5 Word Frequencies**

The application should calculate and display the frequencies of each word in the input text, sorted by frequency in descending order.

**2.6 Most Common Words**

The application should identify and display the most common words in the input text, with a default limit of 5.

**2.7 Unique Words**

The application should identify and display unique words in the input text with a frequency of 1, with a default limit of 5.

**2.8 Longest Word**
The application should identify and display the longest word in the input text.

**2.9 Average Sentence Length**

The application should calculate and display the average length of sentences in the input text.

****3. User Interaction****

**3.1 Graphical User Interface**

The application should provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to input text and interact with the analysis results.

**3.2 Analyze Button**
Users should be able to trigger the analysis by clicking an "Analyze Text" button.

**4. Technical Details**

**4.1 Programming Language**

The application will be developed in Python.

**4.2 GUI Framework**
The graphical user interface will be created using the tkinter library.

**4.3 Data Analysis**

Data analysis will be performed using Python functions, including re, collections, and functools.

****5. Constraints****

**5.1 Text Size**

The application is designed for reasonably sized text inputs and may not perform optimally with extremely large texts.

**6. Future Enhancements**

The following enhancements can be considered for future iterations:

Improved performance for very large texts.

The ability to process additional types of text analysis.

Saving and loading analysis results.
