****#Python Tuple Operations****

****Project Description:****
This project aims to create a Python program that demonstrates various operations and methods related to tuples. Tuples are an essential data structure in Python, and this project will cover topics including accessing tuple elements, adding items to a tuple, slicing tuples, sorting tuples, using tuple methods like count, index, and len, tuple unpacking, working with nested tuples, using named tuples, looping through tuples, and joining tuples. The project will consist of a Python script that showcases the functionality of tuples and their associated methods.

**Project Scope:**
The project will cover the following topics related to Python tuples:

**Accessing Tuple Elements:**
Allow the user to access elements at specified indices in a tuple.

**Adding Items to a Tuple:**
Enable the addition of new elements to an existing tuple and create a new tuple with the added elements.

**Slicing Tuples:**
Implement the ability to extract a portion of a tuple using slicing.

**Sorting Tuples:**
Sort a tuple in both ascending and descending order based on its elements.

**Tuples Methods:**
Implement methods to demonstrate tuple functions, including count, index, and len.

**Tuple Unpacking:**
Illustrate how to unpack the elements of a tuple into separate variables.

**Nested Tuples:**
Create and manipulate nested tuples, which are tuples containing other tuples as elements.

**Named Tuples:**
Utilize named tuples to create a more descriptive and readable structure for tuple elements.

**Looping through Tuples:**
Implement loops to iterate through tuples and perform operations on each element.

**Joining Tuples:**
Demonstrate how to concatenate and combine multiple tuples into a single tuple
