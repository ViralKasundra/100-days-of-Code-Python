# Interactive Calculator Application

**Project Description:**

Create an interactive calculator application using Python that incorporates a variety of functions and features. The calculator will be able to perform arithmetic operations, handle complex calculations, and provide additional functionalities.

**Project Requirements:**
**1.Functions with Inputs:**
Implement a function for each arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) that takes two input numbers.
Allow the user to choose an operation and input two numbers.

**2.Functions with Inputs: Positional vs. Keyword Arguments**
Implement functions that accept both positional and keyword arguments for various calculations.

**3.Functions with Outputs:**
Each arithmetic operation function should return the result of the calculation.
Provide a clear output of the result to the user.

**4. Functions with Outputs: Multiple Return Values**
Implement a function that can return multiple values. For instance, the square root function should return both the positive and negative roots.

**5.Recursive Functions:**
Create a recursive function that can calculate the factorial of a number entered by the user.

**6,Lambda Functions:**
Implement lambda functions for specialized calculations. For example, use a lambda function to calculate the square of a number.

**7.Function Decorators:**
Develop a decorator function that can log the input, output, and execution time of other functions in the application.

**8. Generator Functions:**
Create a generator function to generate a sequence of Fibonacci numbers. This function should be used for generating Fibonacci numbers within a specified range.
Additional Features:

**Unit Testing:**
Write unit tests for each function to ensure accurate and reliable calculations.

**User-Friendly Interface:**
Create a user-friendly command-line interface that allows the user to select the desired operation and input numbers easily.

**Error Handling:**
Implement error handling to catch and report any exceptions that may occur during calculations.
Additional Mathematical Functions:

Include additional mathematical functions such as exponentiation, logarithms, and trigonometric calculations.
