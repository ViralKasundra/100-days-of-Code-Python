****Title: Coffee Machine Simulation****

****Objective****: 

Create a Python script that simulates the operation of a coffee machine, allowing users to order various coffee drinks, refill inventory, take money, and check the machine's inventory status.

****Features:****

**Inventory Management:**

The coffee machine has the following initial inventory:
Water: 400ml
Milk: 540ml
Coffee Beans: 120g
Disposable Cups: 9
Money: $550
Users can check the inventory status with the "report" command.

**Coffee Orders:**

Users can order three types of coffee drinks: espresso, latte, and cappuccino.
Each coffee drink requires specific amounts of water, milk, coffee beans, and disposable cups.
The machine calculates the cost of the drink based on its ingredients.
If the machine has enough resources, it prepares the coffee and charges the user.
If resources are insufficient, the machine informs the user to refill.

**Refill Inventory:**
Users can refill the coffee machine's inventory.
They can specify the amounts of water, milk, coffee beans, and disposable cups to add.

**Take Money:**

Users can "take" the money collected from coffee sales, resetting the money counter to $0.

**Error Handling:**

The script handles errors gracefully and informs the user when resources are insufficient.

**Exit:**

Users can choose to exit the coffee machine simulation.
