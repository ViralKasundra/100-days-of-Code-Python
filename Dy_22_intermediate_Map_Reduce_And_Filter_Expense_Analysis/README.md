**Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to develop an interactive Python program that allows users to input, analyze, and manage expenses. The program will apply a tax rate to expenses, calculate various statistics, and provide options for users to sort, modify, or remove specific expenses.

**Objectives**

Create an interactive Python program for expense analysis.

Apply a user-defined tax rate to expenses.

Calculate total expenses, average expenses, and identify high expenses based on a specified threshold.

Allow users to sort expenses in ascending order.

Enable users to modify or remove specific expenses.

Ensure a user-friendly and intuitive interface.


**Features**

Core Features

Input expenses interactively, allowing the user to enter multiple expenses.

Apply a user-defined tax rate to each expense.

Calculate and display the total expenses after tax.

Identify and display high expenses that exceed a specified threshold.

Sort expenses in ascending order and display the sorted list.
