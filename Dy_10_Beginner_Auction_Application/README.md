****Overview****

The Multi-Bidder Auction Program is a Python-based tool for conducting auctions with multiple bidders. The program allows users to input their names and bid amounts. The program finds and displays the highest bidder and the corresponding bid. It also starts with a stylized welcome message using pyfiglet to enhance user experience.
