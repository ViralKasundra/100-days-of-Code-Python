Python Dictionaries Operation Application
Project Description:
The Python Dictionaries Operation Application is a Python program that provides an interactive interface for users to create, modify, and manage dictionaries, which are an essential data structure in Python. The application covers various dictionary operations, including adding and accessing elements, modifying and deleting elements, working with nested dictionaries, using dictionary methods like get, keys, values, items, looping through dictionaries, handling dictionaries with default values, and utilizing dictionary comprehensions.

Project Scope:
The project encompasses the following key features related to Python dictionaries:

Interactive User Interface:

The application provides an interactive user interface for users to perform dictionary operations.
Initial Dictionary Setup:

The application initializes the dictionary with some predefined key-value pairs to provide a starting point for users.
Adding and Accessing Elements:

Users can add new key-value pairs to the dictionary and access values using keys.
Modifying and Deleting Elements:

The system allows users to modify the values associated with keys and delete key-value pairs from the dictionary.
Nested Dictionaries:

The application demonstrates the creation and manipulation of nested dictionaries, where values can be dictionaries themselves.
Dictionary Methods - get:

Users can use the get method to safely access dictionary values, with an optional default value if the key does not exist.
Dictionary Methods - keys:

The application enables users to extract a list of keys from dictionaries using the keys method.
Dictionary Methods - values:

Users can retrieve a list of values from dictionaries using the values method.
Dictionary Methods - items:

The application allows users to obtain a list of key-value pairs as tuples using the items method.
Looping Through Dictionaries:

The application demonstrates how to iterate through dictionaries using various loop constructs.
Dictionary with Default Values:

Users can see how dictionaries with default values are handled, especially when retrieving values for non-existing keys.
Dictionary Comprehensions:

Users have the option to create dictionaries using dictionary comprehensions to filter and manipulate data efficiently.
