# Treasure Quest: The Island of Secrets Game

The game begins with a visual representation and a welcoming message.

The player is presented with a choice at a crossroad: "left" or "right." The player is prompted to enter their choice.

If the player chooses "left," they are faced with another choice at a lake. They can choose to "wait" for a boat or "swim" across.

If the player chooses to "wait," they arrive at an island with a house containing three doors (red, yellow, and blue). The player must choose a door color.

Depending on the door color they choose, the player receives different outcomes:

Choosing the "red" door leads to a room full of fire, resulting in a Game Over.
Choosing the "yellow" door leads to finding the treasure and winning the game.
Choosing the "blue" door leads to entering a room of beasts, resulting in a Game Over.
If the player enters an invalid choice, they are prompted to enter a correct choice.
If the player chooses to "swim" across the lake, they get attacked by an angry trout, leading to a Game Over.

If the player chooses "right" at the initial crossroad, they are informed that they chose a door that doesn't exist, resulting in a Game Over.
