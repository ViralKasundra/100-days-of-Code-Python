**Project Idea: Log Analyzer with Iterators and Generators**

**Objective:**

Build a log file analyzer that can process large log files and generate meaningful statistics and summaries using Python iterators and generators.

**Features:**

**Log File Parser:** Create an iterator to read and parse log files line by line.


**Data Extraction:** Extract relevant information from log entries, such as timestamps, log levels, and messages.


**Statistics Generator:** Use generators to calculate statistics, such as the frequency of each log level, the number of log entries per time interval, or common error messages.


**Log Summaries**: Generate log summaries, including the most recent log entries, errors, warnings, and any custom summaries you require.


**Interactive Interface:** Develop a command-line or GUI interface to allow users to input log files and choose the type of analysis and summaries they want.


**Optimization for Large Files:** Ensure the application can efficiently process very large log files without consuming excessive memory.


**Project Structure:**

**log_analyzer.py:** The main application file that orchestrates the entire log analysis process.


**log_parser.py:** Contains the iterator for reading and parsing log files.


**statistics_generator.py:** Houses generators for calculating statistics and generating summaries.


**user_interface.py:** The user interface to input log files and view log summaries.
