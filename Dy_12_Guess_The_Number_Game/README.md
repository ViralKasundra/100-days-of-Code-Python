****Features:****

**Welcome Message**:

Display a welcome message to greet the player and provide an overview of the game.
Random Number Selection:
The computer selects a random number between a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100).


**Player Input:**

Input validation ensures that only valid numbers are accepted.

**Feedback:**

**Winning Condition:**

If the player guesses the correct number within a set number of attempts, they win the game.

**Losing Condition:**

If the player runs out of attempts without guessing the correct number, the game reveals the secret number.

**Play Again:**
After each round, ask the player if they want to play another round.
The game continues until the player chooses to exit.

**Constraints:**

The player is allowed a fixed number of attempts (e.g., 10 attempts) per round.
The range for the random number selection is defined (e.g., 1 to 100).
