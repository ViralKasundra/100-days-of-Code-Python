******#Student Management Application******

**Project Description:**
The Student Management Application is a Python program that allows users to manage and interact with student records. It provides features for adding students, accessing student information by index, sorting students by grade, displaying student statistics for specific grades, and managing courses alongside student records using nested tuples. The application is interactive, providing a menu-driven interface for users to perform various operations related to student management.

**Project Scope:**
The project covers the following key features:

**Add a Student:**
Users can input a student's name, age, and grade to add them to the list of student records.

**Access Student Information:**
Users can access a student's name by providing their index in the student records.

**Print Student Records:**
The application displays a list of all student records, including their names, ages, and grades.

**Sort Students by Grade:**
Students can be sorted based on their grades in descending order.

**Student Statistics:**

Courses and Student Records:

The application uses nested tuples to manage both courses and student records. It displays a list of courses and student information together.
